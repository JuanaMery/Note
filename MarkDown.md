### 面试application for data analytic

#### ask questions



**Highly effective questions are SMART questions:**

- **Specific**: Does the question focus on a particular car feature?
- **Measurable**: Does the question include a feature rating system?
- **Action-oriented**: Does the question influence creation of different or new feature packages?
- **Relevant**: Does the question identify which features make or break a potential car purchase?
- **Time-bound**: Does the question validate data on the most popular features from the last three years? 

#### 

- Example: **This product is too expensive, isn’t it?**

**“What is your opinion of this product?”** There are tons of answers to that question, and they could include information about usability, features, accessories, color, reliability, and popularity, on top of price. Now, if your problem is actually focused on pricing, you could ask a question like “What price (or price range) would make you consider purchasing this product?”

**Closed-ended questions**: questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only

- Example: **Were you satisfied with the customer trial?**

 **“What did you learn about customer experience from the trial.”** 

**Vague questions:** questions that aren’t specific or don’t provide context

- Example: **Does the tool work for you?**

 **“When it comes to data entry, is the new tool faster, slower, or about the same as the old tool? If faster, how much time is saved? If slower, how much time is lost?” These questions give context (data entry) and help frame responses that are measurable (time).**



**Making predictions** 

**Categorizing things**  Analysts might classify customer service calls based on certain keywords or scores. 

**Spotting something unusual** 

**Identifying themes**  User experience (UX) designers might rely on analysts to analyze user interaction data. Similar to problems that require analysts to categorize things, usability improvement projects might require analysts to identify themes to help prioritize the right product features for improvement. 

**Discovering connections** 

**Finding patterns** 



As you have learned, there are two types of data: qualitative and quantitative. 



***quantitative data* generally gives you the what, and *qualitative data* generally gives you the why**





**large organization, might have access to lots of sources of data**. But if you are looking for something specific or **a little outside your line of business**, you can also make use of **open or public datasets**.

Research has revealed that our brains are inherently noisy. Certain regions are always grinding away at involuntary activities like daydreaming, worrying about the future, and self-chatter. Daydreaming and ruminating can tug your attention away from the present and contribute to anxiety and depression.

##### Blue girl

The blue girls that bake in the sun / Skin falls in flakes from each one 
Like leaves from autumn trees / they float upon the breeze 
These girls you have loved / are slowly decaying 
Ah / Drying out in the sun / before your eyes 
Wild stares in your face / they seem to accuse you 
Oh / What have you done / to earn this prize? 
The flesh underneath candy-pink 
Quite a strange affair you might think / They gasp and moan for air 
Beached fish on your lawn-chair 
These girls you have loved / are slowly decaying 
Ah / Drying out in the sun / before your eyes 
Wild stares in your face / they seem to accuse you 
Oh / What have you done / to earn this prize? 
Fragments left at the end of the day 
A pile of blue that is soon swept away 
Goodbye, blue girls, goodbye / Would it be too much to cry? 
These girls you have loved / have slowly decayed 
Ah / They dried out in the sun / before your eyes 
Wild stares in your face / they seem to accuse you 
Oh / What did you do / to earn this prize?

It was good what we did yesterday
And I'll do it once again

Only proves you're my best friend
But it's truly, truly a sin

## 李想

**一层楼，生为一个普通的人。**那是我18岁之前，学习成绩中下等，老师亲戚都觉得我以后没什么出息。我那时候和很多同学一样，随波逐流，满眼是非，但是也没什么改变命运的行动。

**二层楼，成为一个优秀的人。**高三开始，我不想这么被人看不起，我把我学习的计算机知识变成了个人网站，开始创业。虽然还是个体，或者是有很多人的作坊，但是我有了目标，在无数的问题中寻找机会，每天的工作排列重点，只做那影响90%结果中前3件的重要事情，剩下的问题选择忽略，而不是被问题牵着走。把大的问题看做机会，不断地达成阶段性的目标。持续到2004年，泡泡网一年有2000多万的收入，我遇到了瓶颈，由于没有团队管理能力，泡泡网实在上不去了。那年我22岁，随后开始了第二次创业：汽车之家。

**三层楼，成为一个优秀的管理者。**汽车之家开始我更注重管人了，我带着一帮年轻人，手把手教他们如何看待问题，如何找到机会，如何把业务做好。我虽然还是带着大家聚焦于事情，但是我能很快发现谁能把事情做好，谁有潜力，并带着他们一起作战，把工作做好。带着一群人作战，目标清晰，聚焦于每一个关键的事情，这个持续到2008年，我到了27岁。汽车之家流量到了第一，秦致在前一年加入汽车之家。

**四层楼，成为一个优秀的领导者。**秦致的加入让我知道了什么才是更高级别的管理，一个领导者不需要自己什么都会、都擅长，而是如何找到更多优秀的管理者，并帮助他们不断的提升，提升自我的认知、协作的认知、管理的认知。也让我们知道了使命愿景价值观如何建立，以及重要性。再加上2008年几个早年创业的小股东要把我赶出公司，当然他们没有成功。此后我变得特别关注人，从关注自己内心的需求和责任开始，到关注身边的每一个人。我们培养出来很多优秀的管理者。从2008年到2013年IPO，再到我和秦致相继离开，汽车之家获得了垂直汽车网站超过100%的利润，对手都是赔钱的。这个楼层持续到了2018年，我37岁。

**五层楼，成为一个顶尖的领袖。**这是我从2018年才认知到的，我才刚刚开始，还没有任何实际的结果。在智能电动车的红海里，这是我唯一能够胜出的机会所在。一个顶尖的领袖必须能够给团队清晰的使命愿景和价值观，做好组织的建设，找到关键的领导者，让团队的每个人的价值充分发挥，不断成长，认知自我，认知协作，认知管理。一个顶尖的领袖必须能够带领团队制定精准的战略，保证业务、人力、财务三位一体的去作战，让每一个人洞察商业、产品、技术之间相互的奥秘。我还在从四层痛苦的走向五层的路上……没有退路。给我几年时间，我再来给大家拿实实在在的结果分享。能不能做到让身边的人都越变越好，提升楼层，一起打胜仗，一起获得成功：有希望、有成长、被信任、有成就、有回报。



李想曾微博发文，回顾自己20年创业经历的5个楼层。**从一个普通人到优秀的人、管理者、领导者，到成为顶尖的领袖，**李想说，每一层的认知都是天壤之别，只有到了更高一层，才可以更好地看到低楼层的问题。

每一次楼层的提升都是巨大的痛苦或意外的灾难带来的，但是我没有退路。当我爬上更高的楼层以后，才发现之前楼层那些让我痛不欲生的问题竟然如此简单，甚至毫无意义，自己是庸人自扰。

让一层痛苦不堪甚至感觉灾难的问题，在三四层看到的重要程度是完全不同的。并非你的管理者和领导是瞎子，对问题视而不见，他们看得其实比你更清楚和全面，只是那些问题根本就不是关键所在。



第一、感谢26年前的李想同学，你14岁掌握的学习方法论至今受用。你当初开始学习电脑时候说的那句话也或多或少被持续验证：人和人之间唯一的差别就是学习能力和学习速度，其余都是骗人的。

第二、这26年里，你的性格没有发生任何变化，所有的优点和缺点都继续存在。你在28岁的时候有了一个特别痛的领悟：理解别人和坚持自己同样的重要。由于更好的理解别人，你开始接受自己的所有优点和缺点，并统称为：特点。

第三、你40岁的时候仍然口无遮拦、惹是生非、令人讨厌，没有活成别人想要的成熟稳重、心胸宽广、理性客观。26年后你的内心和行为与14岁时几乎一样，没有因为环境而让自己变得更复杂，这或许是这26年来最值得骄傲的坚持。



**人因为痛苦而改变，人因为受益而坚持。**（想把减持和收益互换，发现不对，这种更符合现实）

我们的真实的实力远比我们想象的更强，提高认知的楼层是我人生中最关键的收获。



我的时间和精力是有限的。我没有必要把信任给所有的人，我不博爱。



我们所面对的挑战其实都是选择，而非对错。习惯纠结于是非对错的人，可以很好的收获到：1、满满的负能量；2、越来越窄的视野；3、几乎为零的勇气。可谓一举三得。

我做的所有选择都是挺孤独的：

从我上高一的时候，去学电脑，去写文章投稿，我们班里就我一个人这么干；

到后来高二的时候，搞惠多网BBS，我的同学都不知道我在干什么；

到了高三开始做个人网站，大家也完全不理解我在干什么；

然后到了考大学的时候，我要去创业，又是所有人一脸懵逼。我所有的选择其实都不太一样。

“and one thing I found dispiriting about what she was saying was that you’ve got these electronic passcards to get in. If you’re doing a fashion degree, your card will only get you into the relevant part of the building for your degree, you can’t get into sculpture on the other floor. Whereas I think the dialogue between them is kind of the point. My degree was in filmmaking, but I went and did sculpture for a couple of weeks, which is where I met the girl who inspired the Common People song. She was doing the same thing, she wasn’t actually on the sculpture course either. And it was seen as a good thing that you would go and stimulate your brain in a different way and, who knows, that might somewhere down the line produce something.”

### 买房

我的结论：**穷人不应该买房**



大部分人买房是为了自己的满足感。把买房视为传统，当成必须品，而且身边的大多数人都买了。



为了满足感，花一百万。

和钻石一个道理，为了面子花一笔巨款。



**对于绝大多数人，特别是没钱、没文化的人，钻石和房子是精神追求。**

**按照马斯洛需求理论，像买房这种满足感应该排在生存需求之后。**

马斯洛需求里，尊重在仅次于自我认知之下的位置。而且，资产（房产）不应该是用来提高自尊的。

我们应该先丰富我们的物质生活，再填满，对某些人来说，买房这种所谓的精神需求。



**我不买房的原因：**

1. 短期来看，不划算。根据经济学里的1：200的租售比，中国的租售比大概都在1：1000了（没细算），是极其不划算的一笔交易。

2. 长期来看，不划算。中国除了一线城市和长三角或一些沿海地区，房价即使涨，也涨不过通胀，一线城市房子你又买不起。

3. 限制了自己的人生。一辈子花几十年时间住在同一个地方的人生太无聊了。

4. 流动性。拿一百万中的几十万去理财，足够会让你的人生过的相当的体面，剩下的钱可以买你想买的东西。花了一百万买房就像背了一坐山。



满足感应该排在生存需求之后。



“自我实现的人在满足了生存需要、安全与归属感需要、自尊需要之后，进一步上升至寻求人类潜能的实现。”



从出生就被捆绑在我们身上的观念我都是先排斥的。

## Beyond Feelings

**Variations in place and circumstance also can make a difference.** If you're from a large city, the odds are you look at many things differently from someone in the country. A person raised for eighteen years in New York City or Los Angeles who goes to college in a town of 3,000 will find the experience difficult. So will a person raised on an isolated farm. But probably for opposite reasons!

**If you are an American sports enthusiast, you're probably interested in football, baseball, or basketball.** But if you were Chinese, you'd be much more familiar with and excited about ping-pong, and if you were European, soccer. *If your father is an automobile mechanic, you undoubtedly know more about cars than does the average person. If you mother is a teacher, you'll tend have a somewhat different perspective on school and teachers than do other students.*

What effects does mass culture have on young people (and many adults, as well)? To answer, we need only consider the formats and devices commonly used. Modern advertising typically bombards the public with slogans and testimonials by celebrities. This approach is designed to appeal to emotions and create artificial needs for products and services. As a result, many people develop the habit of responding emotionally, impulsively, and gullibly to such appeals.

媒体让人冲动、情绪化。



Knowing usually implies something else, too – *the ability to express what is known and how we came to know it*.

The best we may be able to say is "*I just know, that's all" or "I know because I know.*"



Did you every play the game "Rumor"? it begins with one person's writing down a message but not showing it to anyone. Then the person whispers it, word for word, to another person. That person, in turn, whispers it to still another, and so on, through all the people playing the game. The last person writes down the message word for word as he or she hears it. Then the two written statements are compared. What is usually discovered? The original message has changed, often dramatically, by passing from person to person. That's what happens in daily life. No two words have precisely the same shades of meaning. Therefore, the simple fact that people repeat a story in their own words rather than in exact quotation changes the story. Then, too, most people listen imperfectly. And many enjoy adding their own creative touch to a story, trying to improve on it, stamping it with their own personal style. This tendency may be conscious or unconscious. Yet the effect is the same in either case – those who hear it think they know.

Similarly, until recently most scientists were satisfied that senility is a result of the **physical deterioration of the brain** and is both progressive and irreversible.

It is important to overcome resistance to change for two reasons. The first is that all creative ideas are by definition new and unexpected departures from the usual and the accepted. Resisting change therefore means opposing creativity and the progress it brings about. The second reason is that resistance to change blocks the impartial judgment essential for critical thinking. Here are three tips for overcoming your resistance to change:

和我一直以来的想法相同：改变是好的。think about your one different thing in day.



Most people are quick to accept praise but slow to accept blame.



### 独立思考

**The harm face-saving does to critical thinking is significant.** By prompting us to misinterpret our perceptions and substitute wishful thinking for reality, it leads us to rationalize. Rationalizing is the very opposite of reasoning; whereas reasoning works from evidence to conclusion, rationalizing works from conclusion to evidence. That is, rationalizing starts with what we want to be so and then selectively compiles "evidence" to prove that it is so. Thus face-saving undermines the very process by which we think critically. Unfortunately, there is probably nothing we can do to eliminate our face-saving tendency. It is too much a part of being human to be disposed of entirely. Nevertheless, we can learn to control it and thereby greatly reduce its effect on our critical thinking. To control your face-saving tendency, begin by admitting that you have it. In addition, persuade yourself that there is no shame in having it because it is a natural tendency; there is only shame in being dishonest with yourself and denying its existence. Then become more aware of your reaction to unpleasant ideas that you hear or read. Try to anticipate occasions of face-saving. Finally, whenever you catch yourself saving face, stop and say, "OK, that's what I want to be so, but what really is so? Where does the truth lie?" By refusing to cooperate with the irrationality within you and demanding that your thinking be uncompromisingly honest rather than merely self-congratulatory, you will soon have your face-saving under control.

要面子让我们错误评价自己。



**Tree your first reaction to any person, issue, or situation as tentative. No matter how appealing it may be, refuse to embrace it until after you have examined it.**

**把行为看成试探性的。**



Decide why you reacted as you did. Consider whether you borrowed the reaction from someone else – a parent or friend, perhaps, or a celebrity or fictional character on television. If possible, determine what specific experiences conditioned you to react this way.

我们为什么这样做，是否是受谁影响。

Think of other reactions your might have had to the person, issue, or situation.

抛开第一反应。



**One is that being able to support beliefs with reasons makes one a critical thinker.**



**Critical thinking means making wise decisions, regardless of how common those decisions are.**



There's nothing wrong with having right answers, of course. But critical thinking is the process of finding answers when they are not so readily available.



*We have already noted one characteristic of critical thinkers – skill in asking appropriate questions. Another is control of their mental activities. American philosopher John Dewey once observed that more of our time than most of us care to admit is spent "**trifling with mental pictures, random recollections, pleasant but unfounded hopes, flitting, half-developed impressions.**"3 Good thinkers are no exception. However, they have learned better than poor thinkers how to stop that casual, semiconscious drift of images when they wish and how to fix their minds on one specific matter, examine it carefully, and form a judgment about it. They have learned, in other words, how to take charge of their thoughts, to use their*

我花了太多时间在无意义的思考和想象上。Effective Thinking is a big time-saver.



Are honest with themselves, acknowledging what they don't know, recognizing their limitations, and being watchful of their own errors.

 

Recognize that extreme views (whether conservative or liberal) are seldom correct, so they avoid them, practice fair-mindedness, and seek a balanced view.

和我最近的感受相同。



Practice restraint, controlling their feelings rather than being controlled by them, and **thinking before acting**.



Critical thinking depends on mental discipline. ***Effective thinkers exert control over their mental life***, direct their thoughts rather than being directed by them, and withhold their endorsement of any idea – even their own – until they have tested and proved it. John Dewey considered this mental discipline to be identical with freedom. That is, he argued that people who do not have it are not free persons but slaves. Here his words:



**Intuition is instinctive knowing or perception without reference to the rational process.** Of all aspects of thinking, **it is perhaps the most dramatic and therefore the most fascinating**. History records many cases of important discoveries just "**occurring**" to people. They may not even be consciously considering the matter. Then all of a sudden the answer comes to them, seemingly out of nowhere.

直觉是不经过思考的，但是可以让想法天马行空，it just occur to people.

“不着一字，尽得风流”指文艺创作要懂得利用空白，虚实相间才有韵味。钱钟书认为“不着”能产生效果，需要有“已着诸字”的衬托，而不是骗人的无字天书。



留白。演讲时也需要留白，给听众思考的时间。ppt里也需要留白，这时我们把注意力完全放在演讲者身上。弹琴的时候也是，练习的时候把眼睛闭上，因为睁眼的时候我们的注意力会有损耗，把注意力完全放在听觉上，这是不一样的体验。

【元学习课直播笔记】
**1、你必须刻意地把自己培养成主动学习者**

> 适应能力就是最基础的学习能力
> 被动的适应能力--更快地开始适应--更早地开始适应--迁徙的能力（主动）--改变环境（极其主动）。==人类是唯一一个有系统能力去改变环境的物种。
> 例子：葛优，刻意找模仿对象，不断重复模仿研究总结模仿研究。==每个人都会有进步，世界时刻在变化，就算是被动也要学习，但最终分化人群的并不是学习能力而是主动学习能力。
> “主动”两字特别重要，只有主动才有刻意。
> 比如学外语的时候，有一个通用的有效方法：朗读，朗读治百病。比如正确使用筷子，三五分钟刻意练习就可以学会，但很多人终其一生都凑合用。
> 练习靠最简单的方法：重复。但大多数人即使重复一百遍都跟重复一遍没区别，缺少的就是“主动的刻意”。
> 顺序：先有元认知能力==意识到自己是主动的还是被动的==选择是主动的==刻意去重复练习总结改进。
> 经常要问自己的问题：1、我是不是足够主动？2、到底哪里还需要刻意练习呢？3、我已经刻意练习并进步很多，还有哪里需要改进？
> 元认知能力就是关于认知的认知，关于思考的思考。所以启动元认知能力最简单的方法就是认真地向自己提问，然后认真地回答。自问自答是启动元认知的开始，牛人都是神经病。
> 学编程不难，就是一点英语单词&顺序分支循环就可以走通所有流程，对象函数也不难。但是当语言越学越多的时候，你就崩溃了，动不动就搞混了，忘了缩进，忘了加分号……就得翻手册，这时候大多数人就得过且过，翻手册。但是有一些人就会问自己：怎样才能不用翻手册，答案就自然出来了：那就去背下来。聪明人不怕死记硬背，死记硬背的另一个说法是博闻强识。聪明人会花一下午时间，整理常用的语句，不断敲打键盘，把它们刻进脑子里形成肌肉记忆，然后还会自己总结出自己的方法论。

**2、沉浸能力（长时间全神贯注做一件事的能力）**

> 概念：有效成长总时长（与人的成就成正比）==全神贯注能力强=有效学习时长长
> 如何让自己达到长期沉浸的方法：
> （1）熟练敲键盘都可以一会儿就进入心平气和的状态。英文阅读理解速度的时候是敲熟的，几本书敲下来阅读能力就远超键盘的速度了，只字不差的阅读能力也是那个阶段第二次进阶的。
> （2）“坐享”可以使大脑的灰质变厚。
> （3）在做任何事情的时候都要想尽办法调动一切可以调动的器官（背单词边写边读边听边想），这样就很快可以进入全神贯注的状态，所有感知器官都被占用，所以外界发生什么会浑然不知。
> flow心流，你的成就可能就取决于你的沉浸能力有多强。

**3、最少必要知识make**

> 一定要先问自己，多观察多思考，哪怕凭感觉。
> 一旦掌握基本知识，马上拼命寻找各种各样应用实践探索的场景，把学到的东西用起来。



有些道理是永恒的。

这本书写于 105 年前，书名叫《股市心理学》（Pychology of the stock market），作者是 G.C. Selden，大家可以自行 google + wikipedia 一下。

> #### PREFACE
>
> This book is based upon the belief that the movements of prices on the exchanges are dependent to a very large degree on the mental attitude of the investing and trading public. It is the result of years of study and experience as fellow at Columbia University, news writer, statistician, on the editorial staff of THE MAGAZINE OF WALL STREET, etc.
>
> The book is intended chiefly as a practical help to that considerable part of the community which is interested, directly or indirectly, in the markets; but it is hoped that it may also have some scientific value as a preliminary discussion in a new field, where opportunities for further research seem almost unlimited.

有兴趣的朋友，可以反复阅读。反复的意思是，十遍以上 —— 反正这本书不长，总计不到两万词。

除去这本书本来就很好之外，最令你震惊的很可能是：

> 一百多年过去了，人们根本就没变，一点儿都没变……

反过来会得到另外一个结论，

> 成长的局限，不在于外部知识的积累，而在于自身的局限。

反正啊，这本书会救很多人。

# 生活life

### eat lunch

One thing that your parents were right about is that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Having a good breakfast in the morning will not only aid your body during the day, but also your mind. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition revealed **the importance of eggs** in a good diet. They studied more than 1400 men and women, and those who consumed **choline**, which is a vitamin B in eggs, performed better in memory and verbal tests. Blueberries are another great option for a strong breakfast. They contain tannins, which protect your brain cells and could even help them communicate with each other.

The antioxidants and phytochemicals contained in blueberries have also been linked to increased memory and other cognitive skills. Finally, **almonds** are a a great addition to a strong breakfast. The American Journal of Epidemiology released a study that shows that vitamin E, which almonds contain a lot of, can help with reducing cognitive decline, especially with elderly people. European Journal of Nutrition also released a study that showed that men and women who ate almonds early in the day were less likely to feel hungry later in the day, meaning almonds do an excellent job in satisfying your appetite.



### Sleep

people who are early birds **may have other health or lifestyle behaviors that reduce their risk for depression** — they may have a healthier diet, for example, exercise more, or have fewer health conditions, such as chronic pain, that are associated with depression. All these factors, and many others, could explain the decreased risk for depression, and not the fact of being an early bird. Moreover, depression itself causes sleep disturbances, so it could be that depression is a cause of being a night owl, rather than the other way around.

早睡一个小时，抑郁症风险降低了23%。



**Our body clocks are influenced by the rise and fall of the sun, but many of us get little sunlight in the day and too much artificial light at night.**

生物钟受光的影响。



By getting sunlight in the morning and reducing artificial light in the evening - particularly from things like phones and laptops which produce powerful blue light - we can train our body clocks to feel sleepy earlier.



**"We have these ingrained attitudes that people who stay up late must be up to no good and people who sleep in late must be lazy, but really it is human biology,"** says Malcolm von Schantz, professor of chronobiology at the University of Surrey.

This results not just in **larks and owls**, but a spectrum of body clocks, ranging from very early to very late and others in between.

我们都有一个自己的生物钟，和懒无关。



This is what is driving those studies that find night owls - particularly very late risers - are at increased risk of ill health compared with their morning-loving counterparts, according to Till Roenneberg, professor of chronobiology at the Institute of Medical Psychology at Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich.

更健康。



Past research has shown that about **40% -70% of a person's circadian rhythm, or body clock, is genetic**. The rest is influenced by environment and, interestingly, age.



There’s something particularly pernicious about the bragging of a CEO chronicling their early starts. The New York Times recently coined the term ‘performative workaholism’, referring to workaholics flaunting early wake-ups and long hours as a badge of honour, which can end up setting a bad example. 

宣扬早起不好



The practice of going to sleep and waking up at 'unnatural' times could be the most prevalent high-risk behaviour in modern society. With every hour of social jet lag (the difference between the social and the biological time zone), the chances of being overweight or obese increase by 33% (ref. 4). This substantiates an association between sleep duration and metabolic problems that was found five years ago5. My colleagues and I have also associated social jet lag with smoking, with increased consumption of alcohol or caffeine4, and with signs of depression such as appetite loss and feelings of sadness6.

要规律



But he reckons that the number of people out there who might be **“super larks”** that naturally wake up at 2:30am like Mark Wahlberg are exceedingly rare.



So should we all become super-early birds? Would it help us be more productive? It might – but there’s a cost. And possibly a hidden desire to impress people with just how “productive” we are with pre-dawn wake-up calls.



#### Limitaion

***Media***

What we’re taking in when we check our phones is perhaps the single greatest contributor to our mental ill-health. **For most of history, it was inconceivable that there could ever be such a thing as ‘too much news’**. Information from political circles or foreign countries was rare, prized and expensive (it was as unlikely that one could gorge oneself on it as one could on chocolate bars). But since the middle of the twentieth century, news has been commodified and, in the process, it has become a major – though still too little known – risk to our mental survival.

 

Every minute of every day presents us with untold options for filling our minds with the mania, exploits, disasters, furies, reversals, ambitions, triumphs, insanity and cataclysms of strangers around our benighted planet. Always, news organisations speak of our need to know – and to need to know right now. But what they have left out is our equally great, and often even greater need **not** to know: **because we cannot change anything, because the stories are too violent, dispiriting and sad, because our minds are fragile**, because we have responsibilities closer to home, because we need to lead our own lives rather than be torn apart by stories of the lives of others who are ultimately as remote from and irrelevant to us as the inhabitants of the Egyptian court of King Sneferu in late 2,613 BC.



***think***

We need to consider three topics in particular: – **What is making me anxious?** – Who has caused me pain and how? – **What is exciting me?**



### The School of Life

Maslow's Hierarchy Of Needs:the Top is Self Actualization,Respect is just below the top.

Living according to one's full potential(attention) and becoming who we really are.



we are inherently flawed and broken being.Perfection is beyond us.No one is Nomal.



Recognising that we are each one of us weak,mad and mistaken should inspire compassion for ourselves and generosity towards other people.Knowing how to reveal our vulnerability and brokenness is the bedrock of ture friendship, which we universally crave



**Accept your idiocy.** don't run away from the thought you may be an idiot as if this were a rare and dreadful prospecting insight.Accept the certainty with good grace, in full daylight.Embracing our idiocy should render us confident before challenges because messing up is to be expected. it should make us comfortable with ourselves and ready to extend a hand of friendship to similarly broken and demented neighbours.We should overcome out shame and shyness because we have already shed somuch of our pride.



Life is not elsewhere; it is, fully and properly, "here and now".



'The one' is a cruel invention. No one is ever wholly 'right' nor indeed wholly wrong. True love isn't merely an admiration for strength, it is patience and compassion for our mutal weaknesses. Love is capacity to bring imagination to bear on a person's less impressive moments and to bestow an ongoing degree of forgiveness for natural fragility. No one should be expected to love us 'just as we are'.



we are not the center of anything; We are miniscule bundles of evanescent matter on an infinitesimal corner of a boudless universe. We do not count one bit in the grander scheme, that should be a liberation

## 成功success

take small steps to reach your goal

## **Relationship**



a progrssion of a relationship: romantic&attraction -> reality -> dissapointment -> conflicts get resolved, a growth and healthy partnership -> stability and commitment



It is no sign of folly when we **use diminutives** with our loved ones, it is evidence that we have **found our way back to the vulnerability, defencelessness** and need that we once knew how to express and entertain with refreshing guilelessness 



shaan

If you want to change someone’s mind, first change their mood

### TED

don't pontificate,if you want,write a blog

everbody is an expert in something





were you happy, yes you are happpy.

were you angry, yes you are angry.

so,ask open question, like "how do you feel?".

human are fragile, selfish,less than ideal



if you don't know, say you don't know



conversation is not a promotional opportunity



not repeat yourself



a good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject.



everyone has some hiden amazing things

### conversaion/talk

Too often, when we talk, we stay on the surface of events. we say what happened,where we went,who we saw; not how we felt.we talk about facts, not feelings, which are the only conduits to real connection.



we insist rather than explain feelings, thereby failing to get them into other people's mind



All experiences are individual, More importantly it is not about you.

### attached

The beauty of effective communication is that it allows you to turn a supposed weakness into an asset. If you need to be reassured a lot that your partner loves you and is attracted to you (at least in the initial phase of a relationship), instead of trying to conceal this wish because it is not socially acceptable to sound so needy, you state it as a given. When presented this way, you don’t come off as either weak or needy but as self-confident and assertive. Of course, effective communication means that you communicate in a way that is inoffensive and does not put your partner on the spot, but allows them to be open with you without feeling attacked, criticized, or blamed. Another advantage of effective communication is that it provides a role model for your partner. You set the tone for the relationship as one in which you can both be honest and in which each has the sacred responsibility to look out for the other’s well-being. Once your partner sees that you can be so open, he or she will follow suit. As you saw in chapter 8, it’s never too late to start using effective communication to improve your relationship. It’s one of the most powerful tools secure people use in their everyday life, with their partner and kids, and at work. It can really transform the way you handle yourself with the people around you.



Effective communication almost seems like a no-brainer. After all, all people can do it once they set their mind to it, right? Well, yes, as long as they are secure. Often, insecure people cannot get in touch with what is really bothering them. They get overwhelmed by emotions and lash out. **Studies show that people with a secure attachment style don’t react so strongly, don’t get overwhelmed as easily, and can thus calmly and effectively communicate their own feelings and tend to the needs of their partners.** Secure people also believe that they are worthy of love and affection, and expect their partners to be responsive and caring. With these beliefs, it’s easy to see why they don’t let negative thoughts take over, how they can stay calm and collected and assume the other person will react positively. **In fact, this attitude can be infectious**. Nancy Collins of University of California-Santa Barbara, whose main research interests include the social and cognitive processes that shape close relationships in adulthood and the impact that these processes have on health and well-being, together with Stephen Read of the University of Southern California, who studies the neural network models of social reasoning and behavior, found that people with a secure attachment style seem to function as effectivecommunication coaches—they report being good at getting others to open up and talk about personal things. But what happens if you’re not secure?



**Wear your heart on your sleeve**. Effective communication requires being genuine and completely honest about your feelings. **Be emotionally brave!**

表达的勇敢



Secure people are likely to offer relatively benign explanations of their partners’ hurtful actions and be inclined to forgive the partner.” Also, as we’ve seen previously in this chapter, **secure people just naturally dwell less on the negative and can turn off upsetting emotions without becoming defensively distant**. The good news is that people with a secure attachment style have healthy instincts and usually catch on very early that someone is not cut out to be their partner. The bad news is that when secure people do, on occasion, enter into a negative relationship, they might not know when to call it quits—especially if it’s a long-term, committed relationship in which they feel responsible for their partner’s happiness.

The good news is that people with a secure attachment style have healthy instincts and usually catch on very early that someone is not cut out to be their partner. The bad news is that when secure people do, on occasion, enter into a negative relationship, they might not know when to call it quits—especially **if it’s a long-term, committed relationship in which they feel responsible for their partner’s happiness.**

So where does the secure attachment come from? a secure attachment style doesn’t originate from a single source. The equation of a caring and sensitive parent producing a secure-for-life child is too one-dimensional; instead it seems that an entire mosaic of factors comes together to create this attachment pattern: our early connection with our parents, our genes, and also something else—our romantic experiences as adults. On average, about 70 to 75 percent of adults remain consistently in the same attachment category at different points in their lives, while the remaining 30 to 25 to 30 percent of the population report a change in their attachment style.

Attachment theory designates three main “attachment styles,” or manners in which people perceive and respond to intimacy in romantic relationships, which parallel those found in children: ***Secure, Anxious, and Avoidant***. Basically, **secure people feel comfortable with intimacy and are usually warm and loving**; **anxious people** **crave intimacy, are often preoccupied with their relationships, and tend to worry about their partner’s ability to love them back;** **avoidant people equate intimacy with a loss of independence and constantly try to minimize closeness.**In addition, people with each of these attachment styles differ in:



Initially it was assumed that adult attachment styles were primarily a product of your upbringing. Thus, it was hypothesized that your current attachment style is determined by the way in which you were cared for as a baby: **If your parents were sensitive, available, and responsive, you should have a secure attachment style**; **if they were inconsistently responsive, you should develop an anxious attachment style**; and **if they were distant, rigid, and unresponsive, you should develop an avoidant attachment style.** Today, however, we know that attachment styles in adulthood are influenced by a variety of factors, one of which is the way our parents cared for us, but other factors also come into play, including our genes and life experiences. For more, see chapter 7.



Bowlby proposed that throughout evolution, **genetic selection favored people who became attached because it provided a survival advantage**. In prehistoric times, people who relied only on themselves and had no one to protect them were more likely to end up as prey. More often than not, those who were with somebody who deeply cared about them survived to pass on to their offspring the preference to form intimate bonds. In fact, the need to be near someone special is so important that the brain has a biological mechanism specifically responsible for creating and regulating our connection with our attachment figures (parents, children, and romantic partners). This mechanism, called the attachment system, consists of emotions and behaviors that ensure that we remain safe and protected by staying close to our loved ones. The mechanism explains why a child parted from his or her mother becomes frantic, searches wildly, or cries uncontrollably until he or she reestablishes contact with her. These reactions are coined protest behavior, and we all still exhibit them as grown-ups. In prehistoric times, being close to a partner was a matter of life and death, and our attachment system developed to treat such proximity as an absolute necessity.



Although we all have a basic need to form close bonds, the way we create them varies. In a very dangerous environment, it would be less advantageous to invest time and energy in just one person because he or she would not likely be around for too long; it would make more sense to get less attached and move on (and **hence, the avoidant attachment style**).

Another option in a harsh environment is to act in the opposite manner and be intensely persistent and hypervigilant about staying close to your attachment figure (**hence, the anxious attachment style**)

In a more peaceful setting, the intimate bonds formed by investing greatly in a particular individual would yield greater benefits for both the individual and his or her offspring (hence, the secure attachment style).



**PUTTING INSIGHTS INTO ACTION**







*“The biggest communication problem is we do not listen to understand. We listen to reply,”*



**“Just Forget It” or “Whatever”**

These are common statements that are also quite annoying, especially the first one when someone disconnects from what they were telling you and you won’t know what they wanted to say & your active listening was disturbed. 

Saying these phrases creates an avoidance of communication within the relationship. It demonstrates that the person speaking didn’t care enough to engage in the conversation or to talk about what’s actually going on in their mind. It’s dismissive and leaves the other person confused and not knowing if the situation is resolved. Instead, try saying that you don’t feel like they are listening to you or that you would rather not talk about it anymore. 



**“It’s Not A Big Deal” or “You’ll Get Over It”**

While you might say this because you are trying to help the other person with their current perspective, it’s unhelpful. It may be well-intentioned but it’s invalidating, especially when that person is suffering. 

While they might eventually get over it, it’s inappropriate to say and it makes them feel silly for even mentioning it, says Miami-based marriage and family therapist Amanda Baquero. An alternative phrase is “That sounds hard. I can see why you feel that way. We can get through this together.” 

加油这个词很廉价。



Terry Hatkoff, a California State University sociologist, has created a love scale that identifies six distinct types of love found in our closest relationships. 

- **Romantic:** Based on passion and sexual attraction 
- **Best Friends:** Fondness and deep affection 
- **Logical:** Practical feelings based on shared values, financial goals, religion etc.  
- **Playful:** Feelings evoked by flirtation or feeling challenged
- **Possessive:** Jealousy and obsession 
- **Unselfish:** Nurturing, kindness, and sacrifice



价值观问题是逻辑问题



 Relationships have to be genuine, not forced;ray dalio



Romantic love has been called a [“natural addiction”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4861725/) because it activates the brain’s reward center -- notably the **dopamine** pathways associated with drug addiction, alcohol and gambling. But those same pathways are also associated with **novelty**, **energy**, **focus**, **learning**, **motivation**, **ecstasy** and **craving**. **No wonder we feel so energized and motivated when we fall in love!**



The psychology professor Elaine Hatfield has suggested that **the love we feel early in a relationship is different than what we feel later**.Early on, love is “**passionate**,” meaning we have feelings of intense longing for our mate. Longer-term relationships develop “**companionate** **love**,” which can be described as a deep affection, and strong feelings of commitment and intimacy.

Regardless of quantity, physical affection plays a biological role in one’s happiness. **Oxytocin** — sometimes called the “**cuddle hormone**” — releases at higher levels in moments of physical affection, and research has pointed to its health benefits, according to Paula S. Barry, a physician at Penn Family and Internal Medicine Longwood.



#### BBC

**Researchers have found that how similar you are to your partner can affect your happiness – but it’s complicated.**

Consistent with past research, they found that by far the most important thing for overall wellbeing was the straight-forward effect of each person’s personality. Generally speaking, individuals tended to be happier if they, and/or their partner, had more agreeable, more conscientious, less neurotic personalities (which is consistent with what we know about the links between these traits and happiness).

**Having the same level of extraversion as one’s partner was not ideal for overall wellbeing.**



It turned out that the comparative level of each partner’s traits also mattered in a modest but meaningful way. **Most of the time a perfect match was not beneficial. For instance, having the same level of extraversion as one’s partner was not ideal for overall wellbeing (instead the optimal situation, at least for wellbeing, was for one person to be somewhat more extraverted than their partner).** For people who had low levels of conscientiousness, similarity wasn’t optimal either (it was better to be with someone with a somewhat higher level of conscientiousness).



The standout exception, but only for women, was agreeableness: a trait associated with trusting others and having more empathy. Greater similarity to one’s partner was the ideal situation in terms of feeling more supported in the relationship. Less clear-cut, but also in favour of a similarity effect for both men and women, was **a *degree* of similarity in openness (a trait associated with *enjoying new experiences and appreciating art and culture*)**.



Van Scheppingen and her team speculated that some similarity in openness might be beneficial because of this trait’s links with values and politics (greater openness is associated with holding more liberal attitudes, for example). **Similarity therefore would lead to “less conflict between spouses’ views and actions**, which could be linked to experiencing higher levels of relational well-being”, the researchers write.

> One research team found that the couples who showed greater similarity in the trait of openness were more likely to stay together

Women were happier in their relationship when they and their partner **shared the same chronotype** (that is, whether they were a morning or an evening person). They also found that **both genders were more sexually satisfied if they had a shared preference for when in the day to have sex.**

Another study has found that women were happier in their relationship when they shared political attitudes with their partners. **And both men and women were happier if they and their partner put about the same amount of value on being free and independent-minded.**





**The reaction when two people lock eyes in a crowded room is a staple of romantic cinema. But the complex, unconscious reactions that take place are anything but make believe.**



You’ve doubtless had the experience when, across a noisy, crowded room, you lock gazes with another person. It’s almost like a scene out of the movies – the rest of the world fades to grey while you and that other soul are momentarily connected in the mutual knowledge that they are looking at you and you at them



For instance, a recurring finding is that gazing eyes grab and hold our attention, making us less aware of what else is going on around us (that ‘fading to grey’ that I mentioned earlier). **Also, meeting someone’s gaze almost immediately engages a raft of brain processes**, as we make sense of the fact that we are dealing with the mind of another person who is currently looking at us. In consequence, we become more conscious of that other person’s agency, that they have a mind and perspective of their own – and, in turn, this makes us more self-conscious.



But when you look another person deep in the eye, do not think it is just their pupils sending you a message. Other recent research suggests that we can read complex emotions from the eye muscles – that is, whether a person is narrowing or opening their eyes wide. So, for instance, when an emotion such as disgust causes us to narrow our eyes, this ‘eye expression’ – like a facial expression – also signals our disgust to others.

费洛蒙，*pheromones*，可以帮助吸引异性。

性費洛蒙（*sex pheromones*）的作用為诱导异性。在[哺乳类动物](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/哺乳类动物)中，通过[唾液](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/唾液)、[汗液](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/汗液)和[尿液](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/尿液)释放。接受方通过[犁鼻器](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/犁鼻器)接受。對動物來說，性費洛蒙傳遞了雌性動物是否進入了適合繁衍的發情狀態訊息。雄性動物也會分泌費洛蒙來傳遞他的物種與相關的基因訊息。在極低的劑量下，雄性的[橈足類](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/桡足类)動物就可以循著雌性在水中留下的費洛蒙找到雌性，許多動物的雄性配子也利用費洛蒙的協助找到雌性配子來進行繁衍行為[[10\]](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/信息素#cite_note-10)。

1999年，[瑪莎·邁克林塔克](https://zh.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=瑪莎·邁克林塔克&action=edit&redlink=1)（Martha McClintock）發表於《[自然](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/自然_(期刊))》期刊的研究顯示，女性會因為費洛蒙化學訊號的影響而產生[月經](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/月經)同步的現象後，科學界開始重視人類費洛蒙的研究。[[29\]](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/信息素#cite_note-29)後人便把月經的同步現象稱為[麥克林塔克現象](https://zh.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=麥克林塔克現象&action=edit&redlink=1)（McClintock effect），之後的研究，**部分人類行為學者認為人類的擁抱與親吻的行為也可能與費洛蒙有關**[[30\]](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/信息素#cite_note-30)。

2009年，米勒發現，男性嗅聞女性排卵期時的體味相較於非排卵期時，體內的[睾固酮](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/睾固酮)平均上升了11.8 %[[37\]](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/信息素#cite_note-37)。這項研究指出，女性排卵期體味內所含有的費洛蒙訊號，能夠影響男性的睾固酮，也可能在不知不覺中促使男性採取浪漫的求愛行為。

同性戀的女人無法對已經確認的男性氣味（即[雄二烯酮](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/雄二烯酮)）產生反應，但卻對女性氣味（[雌四烯醇](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/雌四烯醇)）產生反應，與異性戀的男人相似。[[62\]](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/信息素#cite_note-pmid16705035-62) 這些研究人員指出，這些刊載於[美國國家科學院院刊](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/美國國家科學院院刊)的一系列研究說明了人類費洛蒙在生物學為基礎的性取向上可能扮演了一定的角色[[63\]](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/信息素#cite_note-63)。

2007年[柏克萊加州大學](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/柏克萊加州大學)的一項研究顯示，只要嗅聞男性汗水裡的單一成分[雄二烯酮](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/雄二烯酮)，就能維持女性體內高水平的[皮質醇](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/皮質醇)[[52\]](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/信息素#cite_note-pmid17287500-52)，而且這個成分可以被嗅覺粘膜接收。[[53\]](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/信息素#cite_note-53) 因為[雄二烯酮](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/雄二烯酮)具有影響異性[內分泌](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/內分泌)系統平衡的能力。2002年的一項研究顯示，一種添加在女性香水裡的合成化學物質會增加與男性的親密接觸。[[54\]](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/信息素#cite_note-sf-54) 對於大多數人來說，在自然的環境下，並無法以嗅覺察知人類費洛蒙化學訊號的存在，但它的影響卻可能時時刻刻地存在於我們的生活中。證據顯示人類費洛蒙影響著我們與社交及求偶有關的情緒[[55\]](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/信息素#cite_note-55)，也影響了人類的[性取向](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/性取向)與異性吸引力[[56\]](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/信息素#cite_note-56)[[57\]](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/信息素#cite_note-57)。人類學家及性治療專家[海倫·凱普藍](https://zh.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=海倫·凱普藍&action=edit&redlink=1)（Helen Singer Kaplan）在她的著作《性治療新論》[[58\]](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/信息素#cite_note-58) 一書中形容人類費洛蒙是「點燃愛情的火花」，用以說明人類費洛蒙在兩性關係中所可能扮演的角色。[波士頓環球報](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/波士頓環球報)曾報導，[月經](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/月經)不規則的女性定期接觸男性腋下的汗水後會變得規則化。據推測可能是與其他哺乳類動物一樣，與費洛蒙的影響有關[[59\]](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/信息素#cite_note-Boston-59)。

2008年，一項利用[功能性磁振造影](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/功能性磁振造影)的研究發現，大腦的[右前額皮質](https://zh.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=右前額皮質&action=edit&redlink=1)（*orbitofrontal cortex*）、[右梭狀皮質](https://zh.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=右梭狀皮質&action=edit&redlink=1)（*right fusiform cortex*）以及右[下視丘](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/下視丘)會對人類性行為時飄散在空氣中的汗水氣味產生反應。[[60\]](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/信息素#cite_note-chemosensory-60)

#### The School of Life

Psychoanalysis calls the process whereby we identify our partners ‘object choice’ – and recommends that we try to understand the factors semi-consciously governing our attractions in order to interrupt the unhealthier patterns that might be at play. Our instincts – our strong undercurrents of attraction and revulsion – stem from complicated experiences we had when we were far too young to understand them, and which linger in the antechambers of our minds.



Love is a sort of ecstasy that descends when we feel ourselves in the presence of a benign and nourishing soul, who will answer our emotional needs, understand our sadness and **strengthen us for the hard tasks of our lives**.



The theory insists that we don’t fall in love first and foremost with those who care for us in ideal ways, we fall in love with those who care for us in familiar ways. (?)



We may have quite legitimate aspirations to positive qualities: **intelligence, charm, generosity…**



people who are **eloquent, clever, reliable, sunny can set off loud alarms.** This is vital knowledge. We should pause and try to fathom where the aversions come from, what aspects of our past have made it so hard for us to accept certain sorts of emotional nourishment.



**Ultimately, we stand to be liberated to love different people** to our initial ‘types’, because we find that the qualities we like, and the ones we very much fear, are found in different constellations from those we encountered in the people who first taught us about affection, long ago in a childhood we are starting at last to understand and free ourselves from.

博爱也是一项技能



No two people can ever match each other across all areas of existence; and the attempt to do so inevitably ushers in bitterness and rage. We have, at the collective level, given ourselves a hugely unhelpful picture of how love should go. A more realistic and in the proper sense Romantic view of couples would suggest that there have to be ***a few strong areas* where we can meet each others needs**, but that there should also be **plenty of others where we are clearly better off pursuing our goals on our own.**



**Truly stable couples aren’t those that do everything together, it’s those that have managed to interpret their differences in non-dramatic, non-disloyal terms.**



To enjoy a harmonious union with someone, we should ensure that we have *plenty of sources of excitement*, reassurance and stimulation outside of them.(ART,THERAPY,DANCE,RELATIONSHIP,SELF CARE,BOOKS,MUSIC,EXERCISE,FRIENCDS,WORK,NATURE,TRAVEL,FAMILY,SPORT) When we hit problems, we should be able to lean on other supports. The demand that another person compensate us for all that’s alarming, wearing or deficient in our lives is a mechanism for systematically destroying any relationship. Our conflicts and disappointments will at once feel more manageable when we stop asking our partner to function as our long lost other half. The more we can survive without a relationship, the greater will be its chances of survival and fulfillment. We will truly give love a chance when we stop believing it can single-handedly save us.



every human flaws.our friends know what's wrong with us, they gonna not tell us.

***we addicted, it make us away from ourselves.***

***so we anxiously attached to somebody.***



very outgoing type

 

love is not a instinct, love is a skill, everybody should go to the school of love.

if you keeps following your feelings, you almost make abig mistake in your life.



anyone we can love is going to be a perplexing mixture the good and bad.



it's an immense phychological achievement when we can no longer merely divide people into absolutely brilliant perfect what marvelous and absolutely terrible hateful, disappointed me. everyone we  love will disappoint us.



everyone you love will be the mixture of good and bad.



so love is just admiration for strength. it is also tolerance for weakness and recognition of ambivalence.



we think we will find partners who will make us happpy, but we are not, we out to find partners who will feel familiar.

familiar sometimes make us torture.we do recognise they are wonderful and amazing,we say may be she is not sexy, she is boring. so we are not merely on a quest to be happy, we are on a request to suffer in ways that feel familiar.

we tend to believe the more a lover is right for us. the less we are going to explain: who we are, how we feel, what upsets us,what we want.

**love means giving people the time to mature and develop,to go wrong, to wander in another direction and not shout at them but to *give them every chance to grow at their own pace towards their better selves.***



**we tend to believe a ture lover will guess what is in our minds.**one of the great errors that human being make it's permanently to feel that other people know what's in theirs minds without having said what's in our mind. it's such bored to use word. so when it comes to love we have this deep desire that will simlpy be understood wordlessly. it's touching. it's a beautiful romantic idea. we sulk with people who should understand us.



two people are gonna  need to teach each other and therefore also learn from each other.



when somebody ties to tell you something about yourself. thereis a liitle ticklish and a little uncomfortable.they are not attacking you. they are trying to make you into a better poerson.



we don't tend to believe it's ture love. we think true love is accepting whole of us. no one should accept the whole of us. we are appalling. no, that's not love.the whole display of ourselves should not something we do in front of anyone we care about.



compatibilities is an achievement of love



the art of compromise is a big achievement in love.





***I'm trying to learn to love***







**charity**

anyone can expect intrest in perfection,to love is to devote active charity to the mistake and aberrations.

One day we all require the charity o others in one way or another



We have problems understanding love.even though we've had plenty of crushes and heard plenty of songs about love.We still take our first steps towards grasping what love might actualy be.



**kindness**

even sinners,in a way deserve ongoing sympathy and mercy.**it's never simply because someone is wrong,we have any right to cease showing them the greatest kindness.**



**forgiveness**

to forgive is to know that we are in our own way as guilty as the next person

学会原谅，难原谅别人可能也难以原谅自己





the liking has to target certain of our good characteristics as we define them.

“love bombing”: lavishing a new romantic partner with grand gestures and constant contact in order to gain an upper hand in the relationship.



“One partner, typically male but not exclusively, showers the other person with **attention**, **affection**, **compliments**, **flattery**, and **essentially** creates this context where she feels like she’s met her soul mate and it’s effortless,” Dr. Raghavan said in a phone interview. “**The reality is, the person who is doing the love bombing is creating or manipulating the environment to look like he’s the perfect or she’s the perfect mate.**”



In healthy adult romantic relationships, support, desire and affection tend to be reciprocal, Dr. Eastwick said. But in cases of love bombing, attention flows in a single direction: One person tries to become the other’s whole world.

Dr. Raghavan said that people who have been love bombed often feel as though they’ve lost their sense of self, which can take a long time to rebuild.





The results reaffirm previous evidence indicating that perceptions of opposite-sex friends can be viewed as a manifestation of evolved human mating strategies.

#### How to Have a Better Relationshiphttps://www.nytimes.com/guides/well/how-to-have-a-better-relationship



Romantic love has been called a **[“natural addiction”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4861725/)** because it activates the brain’s reward center -- notably the dopamine pathways associated with drug addiction, alcohol and gambling. But those same pathways are also associated with **novelty**, **energy**, **focus**, **learning**, **motivation**, **ecstasy** and **craving**. **No wonder we feel so energized and motivated when we fall in love!**

But we all know that romantic, passionate love fades a bit over time, and (we hope) matures into a more contented form of committed love. Even so, many couples long to rekindle the sparks of early courtship. But is it possible?

**Falling in love is the easy part. The challenge for couples is how to rekindle the fires of romance from time to time and cultivate the mature, trusting love that is the hallmark of a lasting relationship. **



- **Romantic:** Based on passion and sexual attraction 
- **Best Friends:** Fondness and deep affection 
- **Logical:** Practical feelings based on shared values, financial goals, religion etc.  
- **Playful:** Feelings evoked by flirtation or feeling challenged
- **Possessive:** Jealousy and obsession 
- **Unselfish:** Nurturing, kindness, and sacrifice

Romance also is good for you. Studies have shown that people who have frequent sex are generally healthier, with a longer life, fewer coronary events and lower blood pressure. A 1995 study in the journal Demography found that marriage adds seven years to a man's life and two years to a woman's.



***"What dopamine does is it gives you that focused attention, the craving, the euphoria, the energy and the motivation, in this case the motivation to win life's greatest prize," she said.***

#### How your body reacts when you fall in love（CNN）

**It can ease chronic pain**
A passionate, all-consuming relationship may work just as well as medication at easing chronic pain, according to a 2010 Stanford University School of Medicine study. Intense feelings of love activate the same areas of the brain as painkillers, say researchers. Doctors aren’t quite ready to prescribe love affairs as replacements for drugs, but are optimistic that understanding how neural-reward pathways triggered by love will help them develop new methods to treat pain.



**Your creativity may be sparked**

Though many famous writers have credited depression as the source of their inspiration, a 2015 study published in the Journal of Family Issues found that when you’re in a relationship, your creativity may be ignited. Why? Researchers concluded that many people in love start to focus on the long-term, as opposed to the short-term, giving them a more holistic approach to their projects and passions, changing the way they process information. In other words, when you’re dating, you’re overanalyzing, but when you’re in love, you allow yourself to dream a little more.

爱让人想创作。

You’ll hear jokes that people “let themselves go” when they’re in a happy relationship, and there may be some truth to that stereotype. In a 2012 review in the Journal of Obesity, researchers found that people tend to gain weight as they settle into marriage. Another study found that after moving in with a man, women tend to eat more high-fat, high-sugar foods, and further research found that newly married young women gained 24 pounds in the first five years after getting married. Cynthia Sass, MPH, RD, Health’s contributing nutrition editor, sees this happen firsthand to many of her clients, and has five tips for beating relationship pudge.

Once you’re past that crush stage and you’re deepening your connection and commitment to your partner, you might notice other odd changes in your body—including your **voice getting higher** (yes, really). According to a study published in 2011 in the Journal of Evolutionary Psychology, researchers found that when women spoke to men they were more attracted to physically, their voice tended to get higher and more feminine. So if you’re a bit softer with your partner than you are with your co-worker who keeps missing your deadlines, blame it on love.



You won’t be able to keep your eyes off your partner
There’s a scientific reason why you have photos of your love set as your smartphone background or framed on your desk. The desire to literally look at your partner’s face comes from the brain’s release of dopamine, says Dr. Kirk. “This is the same effect on the brain as taking cocaine because it stimulates the desire/reward response related to intense pleasure,” she says. In other words, when you scroll through photos from your vacation together, you get a surge of energy, as your desire is being fulfilled.



**Like repeated exposure, arousal is merely an intensifier.**



Via Falling in Love: Why We Choose the Lovers We Choose:

**When the woman looked attractive, the arousal caused an increase in the men’s attraction to her. But, when she looked unattractive, the arousal actually caused a decrease in their attraction to her. It is noteworthy that the woman was the same in both cases, and that the difference in the men’s response to her was caused by makeup.**



**Get your inside straight and the outside might take better care of itself.**

“Hollywood can place very unrealistic expectations on romantic relationships,” Dr. Rogge said. “The idea that you are supposed to fall in love instantly and effortlessly is not reality and not relevant to most couples who are two, three or four years into a relationship.”



But what I like about this study is how it assumes that love is an action. **	** because we have at least three things in common, because we have close relationships with our mothers, and because he let me look at him.



The moments I found most uncomfortable were not when I had to make confessions about myself, but had to venture opinions about my partner. For example: “Alternate sharing something you consider a positive characteristic of your partner, a total of five items” (Question 22), and “Tell your partner what you like about them; be very honest this time saying things you might not say to someone you’ve just met” (Question 28).

Much of Dr. Aron’s research focuses on **creating interpersonal closeness**. In particular, several studies investigate the ways we incorporate others into **our sense of self**. It’s easy to see how the questions encourage what they call “**self-expansion**.” Saying things like, *“I like your voice, your taste in beer, the way all your friends seem to admire you,”* makes certain positive qualities belonging to one person explicitly valuable to the other.



更多的女性表示。她们宁愿选择一个相貌平平但很**热诚**的配偶，而不是一个外表好看却很冷淡的人。这是否表明女性，正如很多人所猜测的那样．能更好地遵从西塞罗的忠告呢?还是说它仅仅反映了这样一个事实：约会邀请更常是由男士发出的?如果让女性在不同的男性中选择出她们所喜爱的类型，那么，外貌对于她们来说，是不是跟对于男士一样重要呢?哲学家罗素不这样认为：“整体上来说，女人倾向于因性格而爱上男人。男人则倾向于因外表而爱上女人。”

### Sex

**But deep inside, we never quite forget the needs with which we were born: to be accepted as we truly are, in every area; to be loved for just existing.**



**The privileged nature of a relationship is sealed by an act which, with someone else, would have been sickening.**



**It’s ‘rude’ – in the best way. Normal life continually requires us to be polite. We cannot win the respect or affection of anyone without severely repressing all that is ostensibly ‘bad’ within us**: our secretions, our aggression, our heedlessness, our fragility, our lust. We cannot both be accepted by society and reveal who we really are. **Hence the erotic ecstasy (which is more accurately really just an emotional relief) when oral sex permits our secret self, with all its ‘bad’ and dirty sides, to be witnessed and enthusiastically endorsed by someone we like.**



**The pleasure of oral sex is hence deeply rich and significant. It isn’t primarily about a pleasant physiological sensation at all, it’s about acceptance. It’s about an end to loneliness.**

Self-tuition as an essential design feature of the brain

 认知神经科学对学习过程的研究认为，可以把信息分为4种类型：
·陌生的概念出现在陌生的情境里，如，一个不为人知的、在世界上短暂存在又消失的国家历史。
·陌生的概念出现在熟悉的情境里，如，发生在明朝一个不知名人物的故事。
·熟悉的概念以可预期的形式出现在熟悉的情境里，如，和历史教科书内容一致的国家领袖大事记。
·熟悉的概念以难以预期的形式出现在熟悉的情境里，如，人工智能数据最大国居然不是美国。



We are curious by nature, particularly when young. Evolution has endowed our brain with an inbuilt obligation to educate itself. 



In this perspectives article, we posit that self-tuition is an evolved principle of vertebrate brain design that is reflected in its basic architecture and critical for its normal development.

The hypothalamus can play the dual role of motivating exploratory behaviour, and providing feedback, via interactions with the dopamine system, when a behaviour has achieved a goal that satisfies a need 

下丘脑可以通过与多巴胺系统的相互作用发挥激发探索行为和提供反馈的双重作用。

Whether you take a pottery class or go on a white-water rafting trip, activating your dopamine systems while you are together can help bring back the excitement you felt on your first date. In studies of couples, Dr. Aron has found that **partners who regularly share new experiences report greater boosts in marital happiness than those who simply share pleasant but familiar experiences.**

我认为，以一般而论，除了专家的意见之外，大家对别人的意见总是过于重视，大事如此，小事也如此。在原则上，一个人的尊重公共舆论，只应以避免饥饿与入狱为限，逾越了这个界限，便是自愿对不必要的专制屈服，同时可能在各方面扰乱你的幸福。譬如，拿花钱的问题来说。很多人的花钱方式，和他们天生的趣味完全背驰，其原因是单单为了他们觉得邻居的敬意，完全靠着他们有一辆华丽的车子和他们的能够供张盛宴。事实是，凡是力能置备一辆车子，但为了趣味之故而宁愿旅行或藏书的人，结果一定比着附和旁人的行为更能受人尊敬。这里当然谈不到有意的轻视舆论；但仍旧是处于舆论的控制之下，虽然方式恰恰是颠倒。但真正的漠视舆论是一种力量，同时又是幸福之源。并且一个社会而充满着不向习俗低首的男女，定比大家行事千篇一律的社会有意思得多。在每个人的性格个别发展的地方，就有不同的典型保存着，和生人相遇也值得了，因为他们决不是我们已经遇见的人的复制品。这便是当年贵族阶级的优点之一，因为境遇随着出身而变易，所以行动也不致单调划一。在现代社会里，我们正在丧失这种社会自由的源泉，所以应当充分明白单纯划一的危险性。我不说人应当有意行动怪僻，那是和拘泥守旧同样无聊。我只说人应当自然，应当在不是根本反社会的范围之内，遵从天生的趣味

一些公司和大学禁止人们做“坏事”，却没有说明“坏事”具体指什么。这样一来，噪声将难以避免，但如果有一个具体的清单明确列出了什么是坏事，那么那些没有明确包含在清单中的可怕行为就会被容忍。 规则具有明确的边界，因此人们可能会绕过规则去实行一些严格意义上说不违反规则但会造成相同或类似危害的行为。青少年的父母 都清楚这一点！如果不能制定出能够禁止所有不良行为的规则，我们就只能容忍噪声，因为不这样做会招致反对。



这本书的后面竟然论述了噪声的好处。比如：噪声对创造力的影响。 一本好书可能会让你受益终身，因此大量阅读是一件必要的事。我在读研期间才养成这个习惯。

越来越觉得这个世界上非黑即白的东西极其少，不存在什么好与坏，可能。



“有创意的人是需要空间的。人类不是机器人，不管你从事什么工作，都需要一定的回旋余地。如果被规则束缚住，你可能不会产生 噪声，但你也不会有太多的乐趣，同时也无法提出有创造性的想法。”

《梦室》，大卫林奇

Money’s a funny thing. The whole point of having money is to feel free, and relatively speaking, I guess I have some money now, but I’ve never felt free. It’s the weirdest thing. I’ve never really felt free. One time right after Peggy and I decided to split up, I had a euphoria of freedom. I remember I was riding in a convertible on one of those freeway cloverleafs in downtown L.A., and I was on a section where it seemed to soar up into the air and I felt real freedom for a moment or two. And that’s pretty much the extent of my ever feeling free. I don’t know what it is that I feel is constraining me, but I do know that I have obligations, so I’m not really free.

钱是有趣的东西。赚钱的目的就是获得自由，相对而言，我现在有点钱了，可我从没感到过自由。这是最怪的。我从没真的感到过自由。我和佩吉刚刚决定分居的时候，我感受到了一股幸福愉快的自由感。我记得当时开了辆敞篷轿车，驶在洛杉矶市中心的路上，有那么一阵我感觉自己冲上了天，有那么一两秒钟时间，我觉得自己真自由啊。这可能就是我对自由最强烈的感受了。我不知道自己被什么所禁锢，但我知道自己身上有责任，我并不真的自由。

罗伊说：“大卫，过去录音的时候，总会有个像你一样的导演在旁边说：‘加把劲，罗伊，再强一点！想一想你为什么写这首歌，带点情绪！’”于是我开始指导起罗伊，过程很有意思。有天很晚了，波诺（Bono Vox）和鲍勃·迪伦走了进来。波诺那时还不是大明星，刚刚出道，但我想：既然和迪伦在一起，他将来一定会很出名。那次我并没和迪伦打招呼——我其实是后来和丹尼斯·霍珀一起时，才正式和他打了招呼。我和丹尼斯一起看了鲍勃·迪伦在希腊剧院（Greek Theater）的演唱会，**结束后去了鲍勃·迪伦的更衣室，回想起来有点谄媚。鲍勃说：“哦，嗨，大卫。”好像他认识我似的，那感觉很好。鲍勃·迪伦是一等一的，是最棒的。**

几个月后我就把室友彼得赶了出去。事情是这样的，我去听鲍勃·迪伦（Bob Dylan）的演唱会，结果坐在了最近刚和我分手的一个女孩旁边。不敢相信我们俩的座位居然挨在了一起。我肯定是在还没分手的时候约她一起来听演唱会，可后来我们分手了，所以我自己去了演唱会，看到她也在时真是一阵恍惚！我记得自己一直在想：太怪太巧了，我们俩的座位居然挨在一起。我们的位置很不好，在一个巨型体育场非常靠后的地方，距离舞台非常远。那是1964年，迪伦还没有自己的乐队——只有他一个人孤零零地、小小地站在台上，小到让人难以置信。我开始用拇指和食指眯着眼丈量他牛仔裤的长度，然后对这个女孩说：“他的牛仔裤只有十六分之一英寸（约1.5毫米）长！”接着我量了他的吉他，说：“他的吉他也只有十六分之一英寸长！”就像在看一场古怪的魔术表演，很快我就感觉晕头转向的。终于等到了中场休息，我跑了出来，外面很冷，但空气清新，我想着：感谢上帝我出来了！然后就步行回了家。回到家后，彼得带着他的一帮朋友也来了，他说：“什么？没人会不听完迪伦的演唱会的！”我说：“我他妈就没听完迪伦的演唱会。你赶快滚出去。”我就把他们都赶了出去。我还记得第一次听迪伦的歌，是和我弟弟一起开车时听广播听到的。我们俩笑疯了。那首歌是《答案在风中飘扬》，他唱歌的方式太酷了，是那种好玩的酷。

## 8 Things I regret not doing when learning guitar

1.Learn the classics，学歌最有效

2.Figure songs out by ear，注意力在听上，不是弹

3.play with just a singer，录制后发现timing很糟糕

4.The roots of guitar，知道你听到的是什么

5.Not learning piano，乐理很重要

6.Racing the metronome，节拍器不是把歌弹快，而是弹好

7.Jam sessions，找到志同道合的朋友一起弹

8.Solfege，把你听到的唱出来

## 8 MISTAKES guitarists make every day | Fix these BAD HABITS



这里列举视频中8个错误中的其中一个。

#### ***1.Nooddling instead of Practicing***

*1.随便弹代替练习*

Paly the same stuff over and over till it make you sick, no timing, no vision, no concept.

把一个东西反复弹，弹到吐，没有节奏，瞎弹，也没有想法。



**Practice means challenging yourself, exploring and going beyond boundaries, repeating and improving. **

**Try to never play without an ideal of timing and the key.**

练习意味着挑战自己，是在舒适区外的探索与扩展，不断重复，不断提高。

永远不要尝试没有完美的节奏和音准的练习。



Paul Davids把「练习」定义的很精准，和Anders Ericsson的《刻意练习》中的描述大意相同：

一个人遇到的挑战越大，在一定程度上，大脑中的变化也越大。一方面，研究表明[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7839149/)，人在学习一项新的技能时，如果能够触发大脑结构的变化，那么，这种学习比起只是继续练习已学会的某项技能时的学习要高效得多。**另一方面，在过长的时间内过分地逼迫自己，可能导致倦怠和学习低效。大脑和身体一样，对于处在舒适区之外却离得并不太远的“甜蜜点”上的挑战，改变最为迅速。**



◆刻意练习发生在人们的舒适区之外，而且要求学生持续不断地尝试那些刚好超出他当前能力范围的事物。因此，它需要人们付出近乎最大限度的努力。一般来讲，这并不令人心情愉快。

◆刻意练习是有意而为的，也就是说，它需要人们完全的关注和有意识的行动。简单地遵照导师或教练的指示去做，还不够。学生必须紧跟他的练习的特定目标，以便能做出适当的调整，控制练习。

◆刻意练习包含反馈，以及为应对那些反馈而进行调整的努力。在练习过程的早期，大量的反馈来自导师或教练，他们将监测学生的进步、指出存在的问题，并且提供解决这些问题的方法。随着时间的推移，学生必须学会自己监测自己、自己发现错误，并做出相应调整。这种自我监测，需要高效的心理表征。



**你认为犯错是一件坏事吗？**

「练习」需要反馈，但是绝大多数的反馈都源于我们发现了自己的错误，我们不断纠正错误来使自己提高。

所以我不认为犯错是一件坏事，因为「练习」依赖那些错误。

不光是学习吉他，其他东西也一样。



为了有效地练习某种技能，可以将上面的描述可以简化成:



**专注（focus）**

**反馈（feedback）**

**纠正（fix it）**



然后牢牢记住这三个F开头的单词。

#### ***2.not listening to the guitar***

not muting the string properly. sometimes what you don't hear is more important than what you do hear.and i saw this all the time with my stu, hearing lots of excessive noise or wrong strings just playing guitar

Caring to much about other people when you're thinking and it still do this to myself too and i hate it,but i recognize it on others too.

i just encouraged him to play on his new guitar but he was so nervous he almost couldn't play

I just want to see him enjoy the guitar a little bit and i was in no way judging or critcizing whatever he was doing i never do that unless i wear my guiatr teacher hat



NO. 6

**Mistake:Caring to much others thinking. Just enjoy the music.Don't judge to much.**



i had two times that buying anything actually made me a better guitarist.

my fisrt accoustic and first electric guitar.all the rest is a bonus and won't make you sound that much better



the tone is the the hands and on the settings.

so its all in the fingers and knowing the gear you already own 

really, trust me on this one



NO. 7

"i fit that infamous plateau i am stuck,help me"

this happpens to everyone and its very common and its a natural thing

and i found its pretty easy to come out of it acually

remember point 5, seeing folks that better than you at everything,more tasteful,faster, melodies has mesmerized you.artisitc expreesions you've never hear before.

listen to those exact people. why? not to make you feel down or batting or paracin ,no,but to learn something from them its they're playing that amazes you.its probaby something you want to be able to play but you can't.watch interviews of your idols and let them talk about their idols

there is always aclear path that was paid before they became the guitar hero they already now and we all walk this path and make it our own.often there techniques are within hand each if you just practice



okay,so,sometimes i hear something that just blow my mind.i don't learn music by others i want to sound like myself ......









1) Don't use backing tracks  

2) Don't use any effects includes reverb 

3) Don't look at your fretboard while you are playing.

## 元认知

**做能激发你最大潜能和最大热情的事。**

**“当下”对于热爱自己事业的人来说，是极其珍贵的，因为它稍纵即逝。并且，这也是他们给我们的最重要的启示。**



**比喻的力量**，我们很少会注意到那种力量对思维产生的巨大影响。斯坦福大学的保罗·蒂博多和乐拉·伯罗迪斯基通过一系列的实验，向我们清楚地展示了比喻在“什么时间”、“为什么”起作用。 25首先，研究者让482名学生阅读两份关于艾迪生这座城市的犯罪报告。之后，他们必须给出针对问题的解决之道。在第一份报告中，**犯罪被描述成“觊觎着整个城市的野兽”以及“潜藏的定时炸弹”。**



越来越多的研究表明，**几乎所有的运动，尤其是跑步，对我们的大脑很有益处**。剑桥大学和美国国家研究所关于衰老的研究更加证实了这一点。我个人认为，这值得大家的广泛关注。 



总体来说，无论男性或女性，只要他们参与文体活动（包括乐器、绘画、看戏、参观博物馆），其抑郁和焦虑水平都低于未从事文体活动的人，并且有文体爱好的人通常对生活更加满意。

这是学乐器的好处。

然而，男性的受益程度似乎比女性更高。

不过，无论是男性还是女性，都能从文化欣赏中受益。使用这个工具，你能够正确地提高生活满意度，所以没有必要犹豫，行动吧。

“**I feel that life is divided into the horrible and the miserable**. That's the two categories. The horrible are like, I don't know, terminal cases, you know, and blind people, crippled. I don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me. And the miserable is everyone else. So you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's very lucky, to be miserable.”
